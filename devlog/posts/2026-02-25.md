# rip K-Scale

_im kinda secretly relieved?_

over my (expertly brewed by yours truly) coffee this morning, I had a little ready-read of a few articles from the founder and COO (different people) of K-Scale about the fact that K-Scale has been shut down (sad).

It started with coming across this article from Rui Xu, the COO: [Six Things I Learned Watching a Robotics Startup Die from the Inside](https://ruixu.us/posts/six-things-robotics-startup). Which lead to another one of his: [My Time at K-Scale](https://ruixu.us/posts/my-time-at-k-scale).

Then I checked their website: https://kscale.ai/, which had a very interesting link on it to their [whitepaper](https://kscale.ai/whitepaper.pdf) - captioned "This is how K-Scale planned to make money".

Then after a quick stalk of founder Ben Bolte on linkedin I came across his [most recent blog post](https://ben.bolte.cc/posts/2026-02-15-regret).

after reading all that (if you have time its quite interesting, also to be fair I only got through the executive summary of the whitepaper but i think i got the picture) - I'm not quite sure why they failed?

Firstly, let me back up and say I fucked with the idea. Based on the whitepaper, part of the plan was to build a community around their robots, and I fall into that category. I did know of K-Scale through their youtube (i guess the community building was on its way to working) and tbh, i had mad FOMO watching their videos. If they ever got the price down enough, for sure I'd buy and hack on an open source humanoid.

The immediate cause of death was not being able to raise a series A - and running out of money (duh). But their founder has written ["it still is not clear to me why I had so much trouble doing so"](https://ben.bolte.cc/posts/2026-02-15-regret#user-content-fn-funding) in reference to fundraising. Reading the "6 things" article from Rui the COO makes me think that maybe they missed milestones / demos and that could have been what caused the issues? Since I've listened to [Why Startups Fail](https://www.amazon.com.au/Why-Startups-Fail-Roadmap-Entrepreneurial/dp/0593137027) so im basically an expert - I'm sure the ultimate set of reasons were very complex and without a lot more information its probably not worth thinking about.

To come back to the "secretly relieved" - its not like i was actually hoping they would go under. Its more seeing the pace that they were moving at triggered a bit of a "well what the hell am I doing" feeling. I won't deny that the relief partially stems from something like inverse jealousy - "at least I don't have to watch them succeed", but I think it also feeds into a mindset shift I'm having.

Reading through Rui's stuff in particular - there were some things that made me think "what the hell", like this:

>If Chinese startups are 996, K-Scale was 10–3–7. It was wild.

Same goes for the video in the end of Ben's post where he's walking around the house where they all live, at 11:30pm on a Tuesday night "seeing what people are up to".

I've done this - plenty during uni (thanks motorsport) and even little bit at GreenForge. But when I look back on those times, mostly the volume of what I got done was largely counteracted by bad choices or stupid mistakes I made whilst being brain-dead from fatigue. Anyway - I don't want to harp on about that, but I'm learning that hardware/robotics is still for the moment a long term game - and I don't believe that this "hustle" or whatever is a long term strategy that pays off in the limit. This is partially what I think Rui was talking about in: [6. 欲速则不达 — The More You Rush, the Further You Fall Behind](https://ruixu.us/posts/six-things-robotics-startup#:~:text=6.%20%E6%AC%B2%E9%80%9F%E5%88%99%E4%B8%8D%E8%BE%BE).

On top of that, there's this general hysteria about how with the ["hard takeoff in AI capabilities, ... the next few years will be the highest-leverage time in my own life, and also possibly in the history of humanity"](https://ben.bolte.cc/posts/2026-02-15-regret#user-content-fn-funding:~:text=I%20believe%20we%20are%20on%20the%20brink%20of%20a%20hard%20takeoff%20in%20AI%20capabilities%2C%20and%20the%20next%20few%20years%20will%20be%20the%20highest%2Dleverage%20time%20in%20my%20own%20life%2C%20and%20also%20possibly%20in%20the%20history%20of%20humanity.). To be clear - I'm not talking about K-Scale any more, but imo this type of thinking can get fucked. Bubble / negative society / environment whatever whatever AI stuff aside, I don't think its a productive way to look at what we as technology workers "should" be doing. At least for me anyway. Even if its true.

Branching off what I was alluding to above, high intensity effort that leads to burnout and mistakes is not a good strategy in the long term. And robotics is a long-term game. Therefore I am doing my best to avoid any sort of hysteria thinking, positive ("BUILD EVERYTHING NOW") or negative ("its so over") - because it leads me directly into that "holy fuck we gotta do everthing right now" mindset. And that ruins the one good lever I actually have available to me - consistent, high quality effort over a long time horizon.

Anyway, i spent way too long writing this one - better go do some work.
