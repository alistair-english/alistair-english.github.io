# Hello World

i dunno what the hell i did today - why am I posting this online

worked on cake
- making the base implementation use lifecycle nodes
- considering if we should support multi-threaded executors (i kinda think yes, but it makes it complicated)


I suppose I can also add I messed around with setting up this devlog whilst waiting for claude to think...
