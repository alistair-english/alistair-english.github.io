# Hello World

Some background on what I'm currently working on:

[cake](https://github.com/greenforge-labs/cake) is a declarative framework for creating ROS2 nodes. It serves two purposes:
1. baking into a central location all of the best practices I have collected about writing nodes (and providing a one-stop place to add new improvements that automatically get propagated to all our code)
2. providing the node interface as declarative format, allows us to start building up the concept of an "interface contract", giving us some nice properties:
	- static ROS graph reconstruction
	- something to rely on when building _against_ that node - enabling stronger refactoring etc

My current objective in cake is to move to generating lifecycle nodes instead of ordinary ones. This is a disruptive change, but we want to make use of the deterministic bring up and error handling that they provide us. Its not a difficult refactor as we don't have many nodes using cake yet.

## Today's challenge: single threading vs multi-threading
During the refactor today, I "rediscovered" a core assumption in cake that I neglected to make explicit: cake assumes a single-threaded executor.

This is not necessarily an issue - I don't think I've ever written a multi-threaded executor node. However, it was worth some consideration as to if we should try support them in cake. The key issue for multi-threaded executors is callbacks running in parallel. This causes problems for race-condition access in our shared context and in the end it was looking like more trouble than it was worth until we had a concrete usecase for a multi-threaded executor.

## An interesting tidbit
When full implementations take 10 minutes (thanks claude), its worth spending time on the spec. Its also very reasonable to generate an implementation, decide its shit and nuke it without much thought.
