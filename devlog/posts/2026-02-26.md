# Who's flying this thing?!

_can you fly this plane and land it? surely you can't be serious. I am serious. [And don't call me Shirley.](https://youtu.be/ixljWVyPby0?si=xvnMympfml-54Ucg&t=63)_

So I got absolutely nerd-sniped by Ralph loops last night. Ruined my whole evening. Had to eat dinner at my desk while [setting up an old laptop](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alistair-s-english_after-deciding-i-need-to-try-running-claude-activity-7432354645076787201-eRBo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACS0MNcBA5pSsdA0dzxpNpmbG62g79kdnAw) to run claude in an infinite loop(what a time to be alive). If you don't know what I'm talking about (same tho), here's some links:

Good to see a fellow Australian (the guy in those videos - Geoffrey Huntley) being a crackhead online. His videos are an absolute fever dream.

So anyway, the tldr of a Ralph loop is generating a planning doc and then doing (psuedocode):
```
while true:
    claude.new_session("read the planning doc and execute the next most important step")
```

I haven't looked into it far enough to know why its called a Ralph loop. I never really watched the Simpsons as a kid :(

Aside from producing an anthropic bill that would bankrupt geoff bezos, apparently a Ralph loop is a good way of "doing software development". Now Geoffrey does point out that software development is different to software _engineering_ - we are positing that one is the process of typing out the code, one is a higher-order thing i guess. I'm not really gonna try and recreate all the arguments (im not good at remembering stuff) - you should go watch the videos.

Intuitively the loop thing does _and_ doesn't make sense. It makes sense because its effectively an extrapolation of my current process - just juiced up on autopilot. It doesn't make sense to me because it requires letting go of oversight into what is going on in the code. I guess that's not _completely_ true - apparently you usually Ralph loop over a discrete feature, so you can definitely do that and then review the code.

I don't really know yet - but it seems like this idea is predicated on the ability to run claude in a big spinny boi and get _"actually good"_ output over that horizon. And I don't really know any other way to verify or debunk that claim than to try it out.

So im gonna do that.

I won't go into a lot of detail about my setup yet - maybe ill keep that in my pocket for tomorrow if im feeling lazy about thinking of ideas. I also want to quickly get onto two other ideas.

### Keep it on the rails
Something else our boy Geoffrey says is "your job isn't to push the cart, its to keep it on the rails" (or something like that - its called paraphrasing). He goes on to say something to the effect of "if you have concerns or hesitancies to doing this, your new job is to engineer solutions to those concerns". The chain of logic is 1. this is an effective way to "write code" but it has flaws but sometimes it breaks so 2. when it does break, go in, find out why (debug it) and engineer solutions to fixing it. This works IFF the first part of 1 holds - that it is an effective way to "write code". And i guess the only way to verify that claim is to try. But if 1 holds, then i like this way of thinking about this problem.

## So who is flying this thing?
This is actually a completely different topic I was thinking about writing about today - but I think we've gone on enough. The idea in a nutshell is something like "even if all this stuff works, at least when a developer writes it I can usually make them go and fix it at 3am". Thinking along the lines of who is taking _responsibility_ for this code.

but thats a tomorrow problem.
