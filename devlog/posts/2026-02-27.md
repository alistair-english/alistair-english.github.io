# Sysadmin claudé

_what could go wrong_

ok im gonna keep this short because i didn't get around to writing a devlog today and i want to get back to messing around with my new toy this evening. But i thought it would be interesting to share some interesting results from a fun little setup i have going.

Enter Sysadmin claudé. Basically, I decided if I was going to do ralph loops and --dangerously-skip-permissions, I should do it on a completely separate system so i dont wake up to a zeroed ssd one day. So I dug out my old Lenovo E470 from the cupboard and installed NixOS on it. I installed NixOS for two reasons: 1. i've been meaning to try it out, so this is a good way to do it and 2. the whole schtick of nix and nixos is that its a "declarative" system management thingy. Think instead of "installing" a package you declare it in `system.packages = [ somepackage]` and then "rebuild" the system. If you do it right, the state of the system is driven from a set of config files - and i think you might be able to see where this is going...

who is quite good at reading and writing files?

ya boi, claudé

so i manually installed nixos, bootstrapping it to the point where i had a functional system with claude code installed. Then i fired claude up and started configuring my system in natural language. And holy shit - it worked. And it was kinda fun.

ok we gotta pause here because this is the big thing - how can I say "it worked"? I'll tell you exactly what evidence I have and you can decide, because basically this is the entire question these days:
- I tested the system and the desired behaviour was there
- I in passing viewed the changes claude was making and they looked right

Did claude install a backdoor for the russians? I hope not. I don't think so. but I cant be certain.

but also, this is not a new problem - when your grandma calls up "geeks to you" to come fix her web browser - they could also be installing malware on every grandmas computer and creating a super grandma botnet to mine crypto with. who knows.

anyway heres a list of things that i did with claude in roughly cronological order off the top of my head:
- debugged my .bashrc not getting picked up (it wasnt referenced in .system or whatever that login file is)
- created a claude skill (claude configuring claude is meta and cracked) called `/sysadmin` which gives a bunch of system setup context so we don't have to go discovering everything every time
- moved .bashrc configuration to homemanger which is the nixos way of declaratively managing your dotfiles
- changed my whole system configuration from /etc/nixos/configuration.nix to nix flakes which are stored in ~/nix-config
- set up git + github (i made claudepad a github account) - mcp, gh cli and ssh keys
- also started git tracking the ~/.claude folder (while gitignoring the things that claude recommended)
- probably something else i cant remember

oh yeah i didnt mention - the laptop hostname is `claudepad`.

anyway, if you're thinking "this guys an idiot and gonna get hacked" - you're probably right. But i want to experiment with this shit and figure out where the edge of capability actually is. So what im trying to say is im doing it for the public good - ill get hacked so you dont have to. you're welcome. maybe ill find some interesting things

k im gonna try run claude in a loop and use up all my max subscription capacity in one night

bye
